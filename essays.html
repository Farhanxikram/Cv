  <h1>What is Copywriting</h1>
  <p>
    Copywriting or Copy is a highly renowned High-income skill which many claim to be the most important high-income skill for business, but what exactly is Copy? Well, Copy is the occupation or activity of writing advertisements that will sell the

  <h2>The Psychology behind Copywriting</h2>
  <p>
    Copy that taps into psychology is called Persuasive Copywriting. Copywriting, at the end of the day, is just written content aimed at driving sales. When you write a blog post, that's Copy. When you write an email, you're writing copy. Almost
    everything you write within a business context could be considered Copy. Copywriters have been using psychology research as a foundation for their Copy for years. If you are trying to win an argument or persuade someone to do something,
    psychology can make your job much easier, and the same goes for copywriting.

  <h2>How Proof affects copywriting</h2>
  <p>Proof is one of the most important tactics for a copywriter. Proof is essentially showing that what you are saying is true, not just saying it, Because here’s the problem: There’s so much content about today. Millions and millions of items of
    content are published every week. On top of that, there are so many scams out there in the online world. Back in the days before the internet, you could probably get away with not using proof, but now proof is a real game-changer, but what is
    proof in copywriting? Well, some examples of proof in copywriting are statistics, awards your company may have gained, prior customer reviews, and many more. Another example of proof used in copywriting is, say you saw an advertisement for
    medicine that said “The Pill you should use if you’re sick” if you saw that ad you would probably just scroll by it without giving it a second thought, but if the ad said “ The Pill Doctors use when they're sick” you would probably be more
    captivated by that ad. In this day and age, proof is one of the most important skills for a copywriter, because it can help convince the customer that you aren’t scamming them.

  <h2>How diverse customer bases can affect your Copywriting</h2>
  <p>Depending on the product you are selling, you could have a customer base that is very compact, or you can have a very diverse customer base. If you are selling a product to a very diverse customer base, simpler is better, because the more
    complex your copy is, the more directed at one customer base it is, however, if you are selling to a very compact customer base, complex may be the way to go. The more complex your copy is, the more directed at a singular customer base it is, but
    that singular customer base is more likely to buy your product because they will relate with your copy more than if you made simple copy directed at a large variety of people.

  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Copywriting is the occupation or activity of writing advertisements that will sell the product and capture the viewer’s attention. Copywriting is a complex tool with many advantages, but if you don’t know how to use it it can be harmful to your
    business.
